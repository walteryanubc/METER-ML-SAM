## METER-ML-SAM
This project is part of the Standford METER-ML Project led by Professor Andrew Y. Ng and Professor Robert B. Jackson.
Collaborating with previous Stanford research software engineer Michael Feldman, I built a novel modelling framework to fine-tune, train, validate, test, deploy, and serve the Meta AI segment anything model (SAM) on the Google Cloud Platform for segmenting landfills emitting CH4 from free multi-source satellite RGB images.
